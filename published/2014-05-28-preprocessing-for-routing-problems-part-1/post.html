<p>Consider an instance of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem">vehicle routing problem</a>
in which we have drivers that are geographically distributed, each in a unique 
location. Our goal is to deliver goods or services to a set of destinations at 
the lowest cost. It does not matter to our customers which driver goes to which 
destination, so long as the deliveries are made.</p>

<p>One can think of this problem as a collection of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problems</a>,
where there are multiple salespeople in different locations and a shared set of destinations. 
We attempt to find the minimum cost schedule for all salespeople that visits all destinations, where
each salesman can technically go anywhere.</p>

<p>We believe that sending a driver farther will result in increased cost.
But, given a particularly good tour, we might do that anyway. On the other
hand, there are plenty of assignments we would never consider. It would be 
madness to send a driver from Los Angeles to New York if we already have another
person stationed near there. Thus there are a large number of scenarios that may
be possible, but that we will never pursue.</p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to construct a model that finds an optimal 
(or near-optimal) schedule. Before we get to that, we have a bit of
preprocessing to do. We would like to create regions for our drivers that
make some bit of sense, balancing constraints on travel time with redundant 
coverage of our customers. Once we have these regions, we will know where
we can allow our drivers to go in the final schedule.</p>

<p>Let's get started in R. We'll assume that we have drivers stationed at
our regional headquarters in the 25 largest US cities by population. We assume
that every possible customer address will be in some five digit zip code in the
continental US. We pull this information out of the standard R data sets and pare
down to only unique locations, fixing a couple errors in the data along the way.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-r">
library(datasets)
library(zipcode)
data(zipcode)
 
# Alexandria, VA is not in Normandy, France.
zipcode[zipcode$zip=='22350', c('latitude', 'longitude')] <- c(38.863930, -77.055547)
 
# New York City, NY is not in Kyrgyzstan.
zipcode$longitude[zipcode$zip=='10200'] <- -zipcode$longitude[zipcode$zip=='10200']
 
# Pare down to zip codes in the continental US.
states_continental <- state.abb[!(state.abb %in% c('AK', 'HI'))]
zips_continental <- subset(zipcode, state %in% states_continental)
zips_deduped <- zips_continental[!duplicated(zips_continental[, c('latitude', 'longitude')]), ]
 
# Geographic information for top 25 cities in the country.
library(maps)
data(us.cities)
largest_cities <- subset(
    us.cities[order(us.cities$pop, decreasing=T),][1:25,],
    select = c('name', 'lat', 'long')
)
</pre>

<p>With this information we can get some sense of what we're up against. We generate a map off all the zip code locations in blue and our driver locations in red.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-r">
# Plot our corporate headquarters and every unique zip code location.
map('state')
points(zips_deduped$longitude, zips_deduped$latitude, pch=21, col=rgb(0, 0, 1, .5), cex=0.1)
points(largest_cities$long, largest_cities$lat, pch=21, bg=rgb(1, 0, 0, .75), col='black', cex=1.5)
</pre>

<center><em>Zip code and driver locations</em></center>

<p>So how do we go about assigning zip codes to our drivers? One option is to
draw circles of a given radius around our drivers and increase that radius until
we have the coverage we need.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vehl7xPX_wU/U4ZI2uh0iUI/AAAAAAAAChs/A3puKut98KE/s1600/plot2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vehl7xPX_wU/U4ZI2uh0iUI/AAAAAAAAChs/A3puKut98KE/s1600/plot2.png" height="266" width="400" /></a></div>
<center><em>Radius-based regions</em></center>

<p>On second thought, that doesn't work so well. By the time we have large enough
radius, there will be so much overlap the assignments won't make much sense. It
would be better if we started by assigning each zip code to the driver that is
physically closest. We could then start introducing redundancy into our data
by adding the second closest driver, and so on.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-r">
# Euclidean distance from each HQ to each zip code.
library(SpatialTools)
zips_to_hqs_dist <- dist2(
    matrix(c(zips_deduped$longitude, zips_deduped$latitude), ncol=2),
    matrix(c(largest_cities$long, largest_cities$lat), ncol=2)
)
 
# Rank HQs by their distance to each unique zip code location.
hqs_to_zips_rank <- matrix(nrow=nrow(largest_cities), ncol=nrow(zips_deduped))
for (i in 1:nrow(zips_deduped)) {
    hqs_to_zips_rank[,i] <- rank(zips_to_hqs_dist[i,], ties.method='first')
}
</pre>

<p>Let's see what this looks like on the map. The following shows what the
region for the Dallas, TX driver would be if she were only allowed to visit zip 
codes for which she is the closest, second closest, and third closest. We map
these as polygons using the convex hull of their respective zip code locations.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-r">
# Now we draw regions for which Dallas is one of the closest 3 HQs.

map('state')
for (i in 1:length(redundancy_levels)) {
    # Find every zip for which this HQ is within n in distance rank.
    within_n <- hqs_to_zips_rank[hq_idx,] <= redundancy_levels[i]

    )

<p>This makes a bit more sense. If we enforce a redundancy level of 1, then every
zip code has exactly one person assigned to it. As we increase that redundancy
level, we have more options in terms of driver assignment. And our optimization
model will grow correspondingly in size.</p>

<p>The following produces a map of all our regions where each zip code is served
only by its closest driver.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-r">

<center><em>All regions with redundancy level of 1</em></center>

<p>This is a good start. Our preprocessing step gives us a reasonable level of
control over the assignments of drivers before we begin optimizing. So what's missing?</p>

<p>One immediately apparent failure is that these regions are based on
Euclidean distance. Travel time is not a simple function of that. It would be much
better if we could create regions using estimated time, drawing them based on
topology of the highway system. We'll explore techniques for doing so in
the next post.</p>
